            <h2>Psalms 23:1-6</h2>
            <p>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
            <br>    
            He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
            <br>    
            He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
            <br>     
            Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
            <br>     
            Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
            <br>    
            Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

            <p>TThe earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
                <br>
                For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
                <br>
                Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?
                <br>
                He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
                <br>
                He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
                <br>
                This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
                <br>
                Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
                <br>
                Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.
                <br>
                Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
                <br>
                Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King
